    Print and frame have teamed up with one of the largest logistics companies in the world. Fed Ex will be the company that will deliver your prints or frames in a timely and professional manner. FedEx has a variety of shipping options to select from when you are at final checkout. Rates are determined by the size and the location of the delivery address. Below you will find a few commonly asked questions. 

How often do you ship products?

FedEx comes to our facility every day except on weekends for faster and better customer experience. Your order will arrive at our doorstep before you know it. 

What happens if I'm not home when FedEx is delivering my shipment?

FedEx will try up to 3 times and will leave notices at your door. After the 3rd attempt, you will need to go to the local FedEx location to pick up your package. FedEx will leave specific instructions on how and when to pick up your package at their location. 

Am I getting the best shipping price?
Yes, you are. We have negotiated the best prices from FedEx and passed those savings on to you. 

What happens if I get my order and it is damaged?
Please give us a call or email us. We will let you know what you need to do in order to get you a replacement. 

Can you ship to any address or PO BOX?

We can only ship where FedEx is able to deliver

How much does shipping cost?

The shipping cost is determined by the size of your box and the location where it is going to be delivered too. We are located in sunny San Diego so the further it needs to go the more it will cost. We will get the shipping cost right before you complete your order.
